### Future Work
<p>
Right now the chart works and is very accurate. It allows for drill down and image capture and has plenty of tools thanks to plotly. 
<br>1)I want to add new callbacks to populate bootstrap cards for other systems information. 
<br>2)I want to add the ability to add multiple files which will create multiple charts dynamically on the screen. 
<br>3)Create a button that exports a report with all the graphs and information and a narrative explaining the information.
